First Challenge of the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp


This project required some optimization of the code by using html and css semantic structure. I've listed some notes down below in regards to the changes I've made to this assignment. I approached this assingment looking for ways to optimize and clean up the code so future developers can easily read and interpret the logic. 

** A problem or incosistency I encountered was the file structure taught in class showed using ./assets/css/style.css. The ./ in front of assets was creating a problem with github pages and not allowing it to the html to link to the css style sheet correctly. If possible, could the TA's or teacher address this for future assignments?


1. Changed the class value for the content to be a shared content for formatting
	*The contents outer class formats the section while the content shared class formats them individually evenly
2. Added an id for each of the benefits and then created a shared class named as benefit
	*The benefits outer class formats the section while the benefit shared class formats them individually evenly
3. Added semantic elements for the images and headings for each section
4. Followed the readme and made to sure to follow proper rules with heading order and using semantic elemetns for both HTML and CSS
